# Project 1 Description

**Introduced: Thursday, September 3rd**
**Project plan due: Tuesday, September 15th**
**Full project due: Friday, September 25th**

This project is to be completed **individually**.

> **AI tools are not permitted on this project.** All code, analysis, and
> writing you submit must be your own work. This includes code completion and
> code generation features in editors and IDEs, which you should disable for
> this coursework. The purpose of this project is to build the fundamental
> skills that everything later in the course depends on, and those skills are
> only built by doing the work yourself.

In this project, you will create a set of Python modules that calculate the integral of some Physics problem. This includes solving two physics problems. One that is described by an ODE and another a definite integral of an analytic function. Both must have an analytic solution.

Try to make it relatively straightforward to vary how your code runs, even if you do not provide scripts to run all variations or arguments to control the script without editing it. For instance:
- Make it easy to change between similar integrals
- Change the parameters of the integration: numbers of points, ranges, etc.
- Change the boundary condition if using a simple differential equation.

## Project Plan [due September 15th]

Prepare a short written summary of your plan, which we will discuss in class:

- (a) Pick an ODE with one dimension to solve numerically.
- (b) Pick an integral with one dimension to solve numerically.
- The integral and ODE should each have an exact solution.
- Write down at least two physical behaviors which can be verified for (a) and
  (b), e.g. conservation laws, limiting scenarios, key features, etc.

## Examples

A few possible suggestions:
- Use Coulomb's law to find the electric field for some symmetric one-dimensional charge distribution.
- Compute the second virial coefficient for some inter-particle potential as a function of temperature.
- Solve for an orbital trajectory in a central force.
- Simulate a coupled oscillator or spring

## Required Technical Components [30% of grade]

A number of technical components are required for full credit.
- Create a set of python functions that are well documented and have clear interfaces.
  - Document your code using comments and/or docstrings where applicable.
  - Follow standard python formatting guidelines (**PEP8**).
  - It should be straightforward to switch between different integration methods.
- Create multiple python files and import between them.
- Provide a "main" script that produces the results for your write-up, including any figures or demonstrations. One should not have to edit the files to produce the complete set of results. However, if command line arguments are used, running with different options is allowed.
  - You may have a separate 'main' script for the ODE and definite integral problems.
- I must be able to run your code successfully for full credit, so please specify if your code has additional dependencies.
- Include a 'usage' `README` file in your repository that details how to run the code.
- Commit your work to your GitHub repository in a clearly named self-contained folder.
  - Make sure to commit your changes incrementally as you work on the problem. Do not simply commit the final solution all at once.
- For the ODE problem:
  - You must implement an **ODE integrator/evolver** by hand. You should implement both **Euler's method** and **4th order Runge-Kutta** (you do not need to derive the weights). You must also compare to one provided by the `SciPy` library.
- For the the definite integral problem:
  - You must implement an integrator using the simple **Riemann sum**, the **trapezoidal rule**, and **Simpson's rule**. In the case of the trapezoidal and Simpson's rule, compare to the similar implementations in `SciPy`.

## Required Report [70% of grade]

You must write up a report on your project. The write-up must include a brief description of the physics problems you are analyzing, the integration algorithms you have implemented, and some example results. The report should be formatted similar to a scientific paper with clear sections, figures, and captions. Figures should have adequate and clear captions and should be in support of the discussion in the text. Statements and claims should be supported as you would in a scientific paper.

There must be a section on the **validation** of your implementations, where you detail your comparison to the analytic solution and test each problem against at least two expected physical properties (e.g., related to conservation rules, limiting cases, key features, etc.).

The results must include figures of at least two example solutions, including comparisons between your method, the exact solution, and external algorithms (e.g., from `scipy`) you import. Identify at least one situation in which your code performs noticeably worse than the exact solution or external algorithm. Discuss the instances where your solution gives error relative to the exact solution, and how it could be improved. Derive and discuss what the **truncation error** (both local and global) should be for each method used (you do not need to do so for any external methods compared against). Demonstrate that you observe this truncation error, e.g., that you observe the stepwise error to have the correct scaling with step size.

Use LaTeX to typeset your report. You may use services such as Overleaf which can provide standard templates to aid in this or use any other software of your choosing.

## Further Suggestions

Especially if you already feel comfortable with implementing the basic programming, I encourage you to push yourself to learn new things! A few suggestions for things to try that will likely be valuable in the future:
- Use a package such as `argparse` to control your script's configuration and flow without having to edit the files directly.
- Use `timeit` to compare the execution time of different algorithms.
- If your integration has an infinite limit, use a change of variables to change the integration range to a finite one and compare the results.
- Learn about `matplotlib` options beyond the basics!
